# QR-Code-Based-Attendance-System

Note: This project is still going on as of December 2019. The developers (Gatdula, Jonson and Pacomio) are currently working to improve the GUI and package the program as an apk and exe file.

Traditional attendance system, which is pen and paper, is time-consuming and can cause inconvenience if the record of class attendance was either lost or damaged. As a solution, the programmers developed QR code-based attendance system application that works on mobile phones on android platform. Through it, university instructors will have an organized and computerized attendance record and will reduce inaccuracy and loss of records.
